<b>DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE MASTER BRANCH! SEE BELOW FOR WHERE TO MAKE YOUR CHANGES.</b>
##Branches  
The development branch is where you should be making your changes. Anything goes here - this branch is for active development.  
The production branch is where we will test and fix bugs. ONLY COMMIT BUG FIXES HERE - DO NOT ADD NEW FEATURES!  
The master, or release branch, should always be working - this is what we will put on our competition robots. ONLY MERGE 100% TESTED AND WORKING CODE HERE!  
Once we have enough code we should split into development and release teams.
